# CustomListClass
In this, I wanted to create a list, that can get different type of data (int, list, range, slice, tuple). This is just a fun class for me to learn Python Class better and maybe helpful in learning the Class in Python.
The class has two decorator; __getitem__ and __setitem__.
Enjoy it!
