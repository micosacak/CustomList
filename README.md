# CustomListClass
In this, I wanted to create a list, that can get different type of type of data; int, list, range, slice, tuple. This is just a fun class for me to learn Python better.
The class has two decorator; __getitem__ and __setitem__.
With this CustomListClass, I learned how to use this 2 decorators.
